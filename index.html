<h2>Towards the end of 2019 I got into the habit of audiobooking during my morning routine.
The purpose of this page is to keep a list of these books and maybe eventually start writing out some thoughts for each.
My interests so far have mostly been around biographies and autobiographies as well as a little bit of philosophy.
In addition to audiobooks, I try to make my way through textbooks as part of my grad school research. 
To a certain extent, I find that reading multiple diverse textbooks is a great way to optimize for breadth, 
as opposed to reading 20 different papers about a specific sub-area of machine learning that are all just linear combinations of each other.</h2>
