<h1>Bookshelf</h1>
<p>
Towards the end of 2019 I got into the habit of audiobooking during my morning routine.<br>
The purpose of this page is to keep a list of these books and maybe eventually start writing out some thoughts for each.<br>
My interests so far have mostly been around biographies and autobiographies, as well as a little bit of philosophy and books about startups.<br>
In addition to audiobooks, I try to make my way through textbooks as part of my grad school research. <br>
To a certain extent, I find that reading multiple diverse textbooks is a great way to optimize for breadth, <br>
as opposed to reading 20 different papers about a specific sub-area of machine learning that are all just interpolations of each other.<br>
The latter is how I spent the majority of my Masters and I will probably return to that approach <br>
towards the end of my PhD as I narrow in on a specific topic of interest.<br>
So much to do, such little hours in a day...<br>
