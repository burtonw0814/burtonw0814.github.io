<h1>Bookshelf</h1>
<p>
Towards the end of 2019 I got into the habit of audiobooking during my morning routine.<br>
The purpose of this page is to keep a list of these books and maybe eventually start writing out some thoughts for each.<br>
My interests so far have mostly been around biographies and autobiographies, as well as a little bit of philosophy and books about startups or businesses.<br>
The titles are listed in descending order of recency.<br>
The rationale behind going for audiobooks is that if I actually have time to sit down and read recreationally,<br>
I have that ever-present obligation to be reading acadmic papers or studying textboooks.<br>
So much to do, such little hours in a day...<br>
